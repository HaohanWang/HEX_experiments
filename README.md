# Learning Robust Representations by Projecting Superficial Statistics Out

This repository is for the codes that are used to generate main experiment results in the paper [Learning Robust Representations by Projecting Superficial Statistics Out](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJEjjoR9K7). 

Note that this repository holds the codes that can replicate the experiments. The codes may look messy (because we keep it the same as when we submit the paper) and uninformative for the usage of the main contribution of the paper. 

### Clear Demonstration
